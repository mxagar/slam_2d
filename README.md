## How to Use This

First, you need to install the [dependencies](#dependencies); then, you can open and run the notebooks sequentially.

In the following sections I explain in more detail all those steps.

### Overview of Files and Contents

The project folder contains the following files:

```
...
```

The implementation is guided by the notebooks, which either contain the necessary code or import it from different scripts (explained below).

As mentioned, first, the [dependencies](#dependencies) need to be installed. Assuming everything is set up, we can run the notebooks sequentially; they carry out the following tasks:

- A
- B
- C

On the other hand, the implementation scripts and their contents are the following:

- A
- B
- C

### Dependencies

You should create a python environment (e.g., with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) and install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

A short summary of commands required to have all in place is the following:

```bash
conda create -n img-capt python=3.6
conda activate img-capt
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
conda install -c anaconda scikit-image
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
